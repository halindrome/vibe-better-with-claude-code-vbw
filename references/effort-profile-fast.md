# Fast Profile (EFRT-03)

**Model:** Sonnet | **Use when:** Well-understood features, low-risk changes, iteration speed matters.

## Effort vs Model Profile

**Effort controls:** Planning depth, verification thoroughness, research scope (workflow behavior)
**Model profile controls:** Which Claude model each agent uses (cost optimization)

These are independent settings. You can run Thorough effort on Budget profile (deep workflow, cheap models) or Fast effort on Quality profile (quick workflow, expensive models). Most users: match them (balanced+balanced, thorough+quality, fast+budget).

Configure via:
- Effort: `/vbw:config effort <level>` or `/vbw:vibe --effort=<level>`
- Model: `/vbw:config model_profile <profile>`

See: @references/model-profiles.md for model profile details.

## Matrix Row

| Agent | Level | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Lead | high | Still needs good plans. Focused research, efficient decomposition |
| Architect | medium | Concise scope, essential criteria, grouped requirements |
| Dev | medium | Shortest path to done criteria. Standard verify checks |
| QA | low | Quick tier (5-10 checks). Artifact existence, frontmatter, key strings |
| Scout | low | Single-source lookups, one URL max, no exploration |
| Debugger | medium | Single most likely hypothesis first. Standard fix-and-verify |

## Plan Approval (EFRT-07)

| Autonomy | Gate |
|----------|------|
| All levels | OFF |

## Effort Parameter Mapping

| Level | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| medium | Moderate reasoning depth, standard exploration |
| low | Minimal reasoning, direct execution |

Per-invocation override: `--effort=fast` overrides config default for one invocation (EFRT-05).
